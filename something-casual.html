          <h3>About</h3>
						<p>
              For the past year, I have worked on growing and building a new loungewear brand. In this role, I have worn many hats but I have mainly spearheaded product, design, and technological aspects.

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            Personally, I strive to continuously learn post-education. I‚Äôve always had an interest in creating, fashion, ecommerce space, and social media marketing. Given all the free-<i>ish</i> time I had being at home during lock-down, I thought to myself: <i>What‚Äôs better for learning than diving knees deep into it?</i> So, I did it. About a year ago, my sister, our friend, and I decided to create a loungewear brand. This spiralled into a whole small business that is operated solely online and in our small Toronto condo.

          <h4>PROJECT GOALS</h4>
          <p>
            Overall, I wanted to create a successful collection that I can be happy and proud of. As for my mission for the company, I wanted to help bridge the gap between comfort and style with the intention to <mark>empower individuals to not only look good, but also feel good!</mark>

					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>
            Starting a small business entails many skills and I hope to continuously improve on them.
            <br>
            Since our first launch back in August 2021, these are my main learnings:
            <ul>
              <li>The ecommerce industry is ever changing and I find myself learning something new about it everyday.</li>
              <li>Marketing on social media platforms months before launch is very important to create ‚Äúhype‚Äù; therefore, early sales.</li>
              <li>Design is never done! From creating graphics to editing new photoshoot pictures, I seem to find myself opening sketchbook, Adobe creative suite, and Shopify everyday üòì</li>
              <li>Stop comparing yourself to multi-million dollar apparel companies!</li>
            </ul>
					</p>
          <p>If you have any tips for small business owners, please reach out! I would love to hear them. üòâ</p>
