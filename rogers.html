			<p>
				Rogers for Business (R4B) provides technological products and services that fit the needs for business customers in Canada, such as start-ups, scale-ups, and enterprise companies. Throughout this project, we embodied a <mark>“work slow, so we can work fast”</mark> mindset. We aimed to create a cohesive and holistic experience throughout the business site, whilst empowering newly onboarded designers to work efficiently and to promote innovation throughout the design team.

      <h4>EXPLORING THE PROBLEM</h4>
			<p class="mb-0">
				Businesses struggle with acquiring new customers and keeping them engaged. Rogers is no stranger to this challenge. We acknowledge that there are many factors that contribute to this issue. However, the biggest part of the problem was <mark>the disconnect in users funneling into the sales channels</mark> after browsing through the website, which ultimately caused a lack in sales.
				<br><br>
				It’s challenging for businesses to find relevant information that suits their technological needs and the overwhelming information can be overlooked and ignored.  These users need to easily understand and navigate through technical content and identify what services they need for their business in order to effectively make purchasing decisions.
				<br><br>
				How might we help business users find the necessary information they need to make purchasing decisions?

								In all projects that I participate in, I like conducting competitor analysis to understand what competitors are doing in order to help identify challenges users face and best practices. For this redesign, I have narrowed it down to a few telecommunication companies, not only in North America, but also in Europe and Australia. With these competitors, I have found that they are mainly operating with a very informative approach with ambiguous call to actions.              </p>

								Rogers, being a large organization, has many stakeholders and product owners that are involved in this project. Therefore, various efforts are needed to fully understand business requirements, KPI’s, and constraints. Throughout this step, I used these strategies to gain a holistic understanding about what is required:

              <ul>
                <li>Facilitate discovery sessions with stakeholders and product owners</li>
                <li>Conducted design thinking workshops to spark new ideas and achieve alignment with all stakeholders</li>
                <li>Collaborate with other designers in whiteboard sessions.</li>

            Throughout this initiative, pushing the goal of “working slow so we can work fast” is important. By creating page templates for designers, this allows them to work independently and faster in the future while being sure that their work is always in line with the overall visual guidelines and design pattern. Templates ultimately promoted consistency and empowered designers with efficient and accurate designs.
						<br><br>
						These page templates set the foundation for how our redesigned pages will be structured in order to ensure a cohesive and seamless experience. With this, I was able to structure templates to have a clear informative flow and call to action that ultimately connect to various sales funnels.

						It was discovered that 90% of users are willing to answer a few multiple-choice questions to receive recommended solutions.  Relating back to our main theme and insight, creating this “Solution Builder '' tool  helped hit the point of assisting users in figuring out what products they need for their business by producing personalized and relevant recommendations to the user. Given a short questionnaire, we were able to give recommendations of what products users would need based on their inputs. Questions vary from asking users about their business size, industry, and challenges they face with their business, from a technology standpoint.
